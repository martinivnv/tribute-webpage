# tribute-webpage
A simple tribute page I made for a FreeCodeCamp assignment. The subject I chose was Sir Frederick G Banting.

This was the first webpage I ever attempted to make on my own. Starting from a blank white screen was terrifying. With a lot of Googling I was able to piece this together bit by bit.
